# JavaScript DOM

## :technologist: Technologies and metodologies

This project was created to develop and improve my skills in JavaScript DOM manipulation.

In this task I couldn't change content in HTML and CSS files. My job was to solve two problems using JavaScript.

## :x: 1st problem

As the first problem, I've had to create elements that were to be assigned to the appropriate classes and attributes in CSS.

## :white_check_mark: Solution of 1st problem

To solve this problem, I've used forEach loop, where I've set e.g. appropriate classes and attributes for new-created elements.

## :x: 2nd problem

As the second problem, I've had to create a two-level list using the properties in the object.

## :white_check_mark: Solution of second problem

In this case, I also used the forEach loop, but in the beginning I had to create the first level of the menu. After this, I've used querySelectorAll, to find new-created elements (li) and set them appropriate li elements as a second level of the list.
